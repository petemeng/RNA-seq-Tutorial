1: In fgseaMultilevel(pathways = pathways, stats = stats, minSize = minSize,  :
  For some of the pathways the P-values were likely overestimated. For such pathways log2err is set to NA.
2: In fgseaMultilevel(pathways = pathways, stats = stats, minSize = minSize,  :
  For some pathways, in reality P-values are less than 1e-10. You can set the `eps` argument to zero for better estimation.
